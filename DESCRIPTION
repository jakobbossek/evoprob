Title: Evolutionary Algorithm to Produce Diverse Problems
Description: An EA which aims for the generation of a diverse set of instances for combinatorial optimization problems for \eqn{n \geq 2} algorithms. Diverse means that the resulting instance set covers all \eqn{n!} possible rankings of the algorithms on the evolved problems equally.
